Github watching app
======================================

Simple use of Github's JSON feed to pull out a user's watched & owned repositories. The reason for creating it was due to the fact that I thought Github's implementation was lacking somewhat. I realise that my 'solution' is not perfect, but it is a work-in-progress that I fully intend on improving in the coming weeks.
