Github watching app
======================================

Simple use of Github's JSON feed to pull out a user's watched & owned repositories; I thought Github's implementation was lacking somewhat so I sert about trying to improve on it. I realise that my 'solution' is not perfect, but it is more of an experiment & learning tool.

## Upcoming

1. Get a list of the inputted user's starred gists (I am fairly  ertian that this is not possible - see: http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/)
2. Currently, the app only displays the first 100 results, I would like to show more by either paginating or infinitely scrolling. I do not know how to do this yet, but will have a go. **Any suggestions on this would be really appreciated.** See: http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination
3. If you are already logged in to Github, I'd like to display a list of the users you follow so you can see their repos. All I need to do is

## Help me improve

This little app is a way for me to build something that I would not normally build, I am stumbling through & would love it, if you come across a bad habit or something that could be made more efficient, if you could let me know how I could improve the app.
