BOOST enhanced boilerplate framework
======================================

**BOOST** is a Boilerplate framework that's kind of a best of everything that I find useful. There's a responsive grid, form styling and many other useful bits and pieces. Basically, it's a blend of @h5bp, '320 and up' by @malarkey, @inuitcss, formalize.me by @nathansmith & Skeleton by @dhgamache - you guys rock!


Let's get started
-----------------

**BOOST** uses the 'mobile-first' methodology & to find out more, please read the excellent post 'Mobile First' by Luke Wroblewski at http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933
